Glass Cannon by sdwvit

This mode does only one thing: increases weapons damage quite a bit on Hard difficulty.

🤠 Here’s the deal, kiddo - this mod makes you a glass cannon, so you’re basically one-shotting everything, at the same time you’ll get wrecked by every bullet, every mutant, every *thing* that’s not you.
It’s brutal as hell… but *so* much more satisfying when you pull through.
It’s not for the weak. If you’re struggling? Just switch to Normal mode for that one fight - no shame in that. This thing’s all about fun, not suffering.
Hard mission, but you’ve got this. Now go prove it. 🤠

Increases damage given and damage taken to 400%
