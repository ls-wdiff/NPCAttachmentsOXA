This mod restores the original OST to the 100 Rads Bar
[hr][/hr]
In the quiet moments after a long run, there’s a strange feeling — like coming home. Safe. You don’t want to leave. Eat some sausage, trade a few items, whisper to yourself: “Yeah, still alive. Still here.” [h1][/h1] 
But why go back out? Outside, it’s raining, and bullets are flying again — hide, run, survive. But here, it’s warm. The light glows softly. [h1][/h1]
And there’s that guy — the one who’ll do two or three more runs like yesterday, earn his share, finally cut ties with the Zone… and come back, alive, unharmed. Yet, as the evening falls, by the little cottage near the river, he feels a pull — back toward the danger, back toward the Zone. Not because he must. But because he’s drawn to it. [h1][/h1]
Like home.
